# Architecture

## System shape

NeuraLoc-Core is a Tauri v2 application with a React/TypeScript renderer and a Rust core. UI communication uses Tauri commands and events. Native engines may expose loopback HTTP internally because upstream binaries require it, but that transport is owned by the Rust engine adapter and is never the normal UI boundary.

## Rust core boundaries

### Commands

Commands deserialize and validate IPC input, call one domain service, and map domain errors to stable IPC errors. Commands do not spawn processes, query arbitrary files, or contain model-family rules.

### Engine adapters

All inference engines implement a shared lifecycle and expose workload-specific traits where needed.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait InferenceEngine: Send + Sync {
    fn engine_id(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> EngineCapabilities;
    async fn prepare(&self, config: EngineConfig) -> EngineResult<()>;
    async fn start(&self, request: EngineStartRequest) -> EngineResult<EngineHandle>;
    async fn stop(&self) -> EngineResult<()>;
    async fn health(&self) -> EngineResult<EngineHealth>;
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait ChatEngine: InferenceEngine {
    async fn load_model(&self, request: ChatModelRequest) -> EngineResult<ModelSession>;
    async fn generate(&self, request: ChatRequest, sink: TokenSink) -> EngineResult<Usage>;
    async fn cancel(&self, job_id: JobId) -> EngineResult<()>;
}
```

`EngineHandle` contains an opaque owned-process ID, selected endpoint if required, backend version, and lifecycle state. It never exposes a raw mutable child handle to callers.

### Process manager

The process manager is the sole child-process entry point. It accepts executable paths and argument arrays, assigns an ownership token, captures bounded logs, tracks start time and PID, and performs graceful then forced shutdown only for its own live handles. It never kills by port number or executable name.

### Scheduler

Jobs enter a bounded queue with workload, compatible devices, estimated memory, priority, cancellation token, and persistence policy. The resource policy selects a device and decides whether another model must unload. The scheduler cannot override engine compatibility.

### Storage

Repositories own SQL and return domain records. Migrations are ordered, transactional, and recorded in `schema_migrations`. Files are committed with write-to-temporary, flush, checksum where relevant, and atomic rename.

## State ownership

`AppState` contains thread-safe handles to services, not mutable business records:

- `Database`
- `HardwareService`
- `ProcessManager`
- `Scheduler`
- `SettingsService`
- `PromptService`
- engine registry
- cancellation registry

React state is split into UI session state, persisted user settings, and server-derived snapshots. Zustand stores own only their feature state. TanStack Query may be introduced for cached IPC reads once request volume warrants it.

The mounted Chat workspace holds an immutable selected prompt version for the current ephemeral conversation. It refreshes latest library summaries after Prompt Library navigation without replacing an older bound version. Generation places the exact compiled prompt content first with the `system` role; changing the selection after a turn explicitly starts a new conversation. SQLite-backed conversation ownership replaces this renderer binding in the persistence checkpoint.

## SQLite schema

SQLite runs in WAL mode with foreign keys enabled and a busy timeout. Large files stay outside the database.

## IPC contract

Commands are versioned at the Rust type level. Breaking payload changes create a new command name during migration.

| Command | Request | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_app_snapshot` | none | settings summary, running engines, active jobs |
| `get_hardware_snapshot` | none | devices, memory, disks, capabilities, warnings |
| `refresh_hardware` | none | fresh hardware snapshot |
| `get_settings` | none | complete non-secret settings |
| `update_settings` | typed patch | validated settings |
| `list_models` | none | model summaries |
| `import_model` | dialog-granted GGUF path | indexed model and duplicate state |
| `scan_model_folder` | scan ID and dialog-granted folder | scan summary |
| `cancel_model_scan` | scan ID | accepted/current state |
| `reverify_model` | model ID | updated model summary |
| `remove_model_record` | model ID | metadata removal result |
| `get_engine_status` | none | package/session lifecycle, identities, backend version, and loaded context capacity |
| `get_engine_health` | none | owned loopback readiness/identity result |
| `start_engine` | model ID, optional context/threads | ready engine status |
| `stop_engine` | engine session ID | final engine status |
| `get_engine_logs` | engine session ID | bounded redacted log snapshot |
| `start_chat_generation` | job/conversation/message/session IDs, bounded messages, output limit | non-thinking visible text, completed/cancelled result, and usage while token events stream |
| `cancel_chat_generation` | job ID | cancellation accepted |
| `submit_job` | typed job request | job ID |
| `cancel_job` | job ID | accepted/current state |
| `list_prompts` | search/filter | prompt summaries |
| `import_prompt` | granted path | profile and immutable version |
| `create_prompt` | stable name and document | profile and immutable version 1 |
| `save_prompt` | profile ID/base version/content | new immutable version |
| `get_prompt_version` | immutable version ID | exact source, content, metadata, and provenance |
| `duplicate_prompt` | source version and optional name | new profile/version with provenance |
| `set_prompt_pinned` | profile ID and pin state | updated prompt summary |
| `delete_prompt` | profile ID | soft-delete result |
| `export_prompt` | version ID and original/normalized mode | file name and document content |
| `compile_prompt` | immutable version ID | exact selected-prompt content and approximate token estimate |
| `list_conversations` | search/page | conversation summaries |
| `send_chat_message` | conversation/message/settings | job ID |
| `get_diagnostics` | redaction level | diagnostics bundle preview |

Events use `{ eventVersion, sequence, emittedAt, payload }` envelopes. Model scan progress plus engine state/log events are implemented; the remaining names are contracts for later phases:

- `hardware://updated`
- `engine://state-changed`
- `engine://log-line`
- `job://state-changed`
- `job://progress`
- `model://scan-progress`
- `chat://token`
- `chat://usage`
- `chat://state-changed`
- `download://progress`
- `download://state-changed`
- `telemetry://sample`
- `settings://changed`

Streaming events include a job ID and monotonically increasing sequence. The UI ignores duplicate or stale sequences. High-frequency telemetry is throttled in Rust; tokens may be batched for renderer efficiency.

## Lifecycle model

Valid engine transitions are explicit:

```text
NotInstalled -> Installed -> Starting -> LoadingModel -> Ready -> Busy
Busy -> Ready
Ready|Busy -> Stopping -> Stopped
Starting|LoadingModel|Ready|Busy -> Crashed -> Recovering -> Starting
Any active state -> Error
```

Recovery is bounded. A crash may restart at most twice within ten minutes by default. OOM fallback is a separate, user-configurable policy and records every changed setting.

## Internal transport and ports

Adapters reserve a loopback port by binding port `0`, retaining the listener until immediately before spawn where backend behavior permits. The llama.cpp adapter binds only `127.0.0.1`, passes a random API key through the cleared child environment, waits on `/health`, challenges `/props` with a wrong key, then requires the correct key to report the canonical selected model and pinned build. Port conflicts retry without killing the occupant; the renderer never receives the endpoint or token.

## Testing architecture

Unit tests cover pure policy and parsing. Integration tests launch copied deterministic executables for bounded logs, probes, natural exit, crash, and forced stop. One ignored network test downloads the official pinned package and verifies its real build output and file lifecycle. A second ignored environment-selected test loads a real tensor-bearing GGUF, checks health, requires a known visible answer with model thinking disabled, streams usage, cancels a second active request, stops the server, and asserts that no owned child remains; it passed locally with Qwen3 4B Q4_K_M on 2026-07-14. Hardware probes support injected fixtures so CI does not require a GPU or NPU. Database tests use temporary files and run every migration from an empty and previous-version database. A small redistributable tensor-bearing GGUF is still needed before real-model coverage can run in normal CI.
