# NeuraLoc-Core

NeuraLoc-Core is a privacy-first Windows desktop application for discovering, managing, and running local AI models through verified native inference engines. The application uses React and TypeScript for the interface, Tauri 2 for the desktop boundary, Rust for orchestration, and SQLite for durable metadata.

Current version: `0.1.0`, local-chat checkpoint in progress. Hardware/settings functionality, local GGUF indexing, the verified pinned llama.cpp Windows x64 CPU package, owned model launch/stop, bounded streaming chat, live context telemetry, the secure versioned Prompt Library, durable conversation history, independent branches/retry, and provenance-preserving Markdown export are implemented. A real opt-in Qwen3 4B load/stream/stop test passed on 2026-07-14. Multi-layer prompt composition, enforced context strategies, advanced model fit behavior, and the download catalog remain ahead. See `STATUS.md` for the exact implementation state and `NEXT_STEPS.md` for the dependency-aware plan.

## Requirements

- Windows 11
- Node.js 22 or newer (verified with `v24.18.0`)
- npm (verified with `11.16.0`)
- Rust stable MSVC toolchain (verified with Rust/Cargo `1.97.0`)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with Desktop development with C++ and a Windows SDK
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime

Verify the native toolchain in a new PowerShell window:

```powershell
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup show active-toolchain
node --version
npm.cmd --version
```

The Rust toolchain should end in `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. If `rustc` or `cargo` is not found, add `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` to the user `PATH`, restart PowerShell/Codex, or set it for the current session:

```powershell
$env:Path = "$HOME\.cargo\bin;$env:Path"
```

## Install

From the standalone project directory:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Users\atrx07\atrx\NeuraLoc-Core
npm.cmd ci
```

`npm ci` uses the committed lock file and is preferred for a reproducible checkout. Use `npm.cmd install` only when intentionally changing JavaScript dependencies.

## Run the Desktop App

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Users\atrx07\atrx\NeuraLoc-Core
$env:Path = "$HOME\.cargo\bin;$env:Path"
npm.cmd run tauri -- dev
```

Tauri starts Vite on `http://localhost:1420` and opens the native NeuraLoc-Core window. Port 1420 is configured as strict, so stop another process using it before launching development mode.

## First Local Model Test

The current prototype runs GGUF models locally through the verified llama.cpp CPU runtime. The model catalog and Downloads workflow are not enabled yet, so the first model file must be obtained separately as a `.gguf` file and imported into the local library. The llama.cpp runtime package can be installed or imported from Model Manager.

1. Start the desktop app with `npm.cmd run tauri -- dev`.
2. Open `Model Manager` from the left navigation.
3. In the runtime section, install or import the pinned `llama.cpp CPU runtime`, then click `Verify` until it reports `Ready`. Online installation requires Internet access to be enabled in Settings; offline package import is supported when you already have the approved archive.
4. Click `Import GGUF` and choose a model file, or use `Scan folder` for a directory containing GGUF files.
5. Wait for the model row to show `Ready`. If the model is listed as missing or invalid, use `Verify` after confirming that the file still exists and is a regular `.gguf` file.
6. Open `Chat`, choose the ready model in the `Model` selector, and wait for `Ready on CPU`. Selecting a ready model loads it into the owned local runtime.
7. Optional prompt test: open `Prompt Library`, import a UTF-8 `.md`/`.txt` document or create one locally, then return to Chat and choose its immutable version from the `System prompt` selector. Changing this selector after messages exist requires confirmation and starts a new conversation.
8. Send a small first prompt such as:

   ```text
   Hello. Confirm that you are running locally in one short sentence.
   ```

9. Read the response. The usage line appears at the bottom of the assistant message and reports output tokens, prompt tokens, and measured speed. The compact strip above the composer shows context usage, context capacity, selected prompt version, output progress, generation state, speed, and the active CPU/backend route.
10. Use the conversation rail to rename or pin the saved chat, export its bounded Markdown transcript with the download icon, start another conversation, then reopen the first one. Restarting the app restores the last opened durable conversation and its exact model/prompt bindings.
11. To test branching, use a message's `Branch from here` icon. Chat should open a new history entry labeled `Branch`, preserve the selected prefix and settings, and leave the original conversation unchanged.
12. To test retry, use the assistant message's `Retry in new branch` icon while its model is loaded. Chat should branch immediately before that user turn, resend it, and stream a fresh answer into the new branch. Reopen the original from history to verify its response is unchanged.
13. To test cancellation, send a longer prompt and press the square `Stop generation` button while the model is responding. The partial turn should end as stopped and remain identifiable in local history.
14. When finished, use the square button in the Chat header to unload the model. The runtime remains owned by NeuraLoc-Core and is stopped without killing unrelated processes.

The first verified local run used a Qwen3 4B Q4_K_M GGUF with the pinned llama.cpp `b9986` Windows x64 CPU build. On a CPU-only route, high CPU utilization during generation is expected. The first response can also take longer while the model is loading into memory.

### First-Test Troubleshooting

- If an imported model does not appear in Chat, return to Model Manager and confirm that its verification state is `Ready`, then reopen Chat so it refreshes the model library.
- If Chat says `No model selected`, choose the model from the selector rather than typing into the composer. The composer stays disabled until the matching runtime session is ready.
- If a response is still generating, use the visible stop button. Open `Logs` or the runtime log section in Model Manager if the process reports an error.
- If the context strip shows a `~` prefix during generation, the number is an explicitly approximate live estimate. Final llama.cpp usage replaces it after the response completes.
- Native chat turns are transactionally stored in SQLite before generation and finalized with usage/terminal state afterward. The rail supports search, lazy open, rename, pin, branch, provenance-preserving Markdown export, delete, and restart restoration; Retry always generates into a new branch, and an interrupted draft is shown explicitly rather than disappearing.

## Browser UI Preview

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:1420`. Browser mode uses representative hardware data and in-memory settings. It does not test native hardware probes, SQLite, child processes, filesystem access, or Tauri IPC.

Browser mode includes read-only sample prompt and conversation records for layout, selector, history, and restoration testing. Native mutations and SQLite persistence require the Tauri desktop app.

## Verification

Run the frontend checks:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run test
```

Run the Rust checks:

```powershell
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets
```

Clippy currently reports expected dead-code warnings for future engine, scheduler, event, and process interfaces; it exits successfully.

Build an unpackaged Windows debug executable:

```powershell
$env:Path = "$HOME\.cargo\bin;$env:Path"
npm.cmd run tauri -- build --debug --no-bundle
```

Output:

```text
C:\Users\atrx07\atrx\NeuraLoc-Core\src-tauri\target\debug\neuraloc-core.exe
```

Build the configured NSIS release bundle when release packaging is needed:

```powershell
$env:Path = "$HOME\.cargo\bin;$env:Path"
npm.cmd run tauri -- build
```

Release packaging is not yet code-signed and should not be treated as a production distribution.

## Data and Privacy

On first native launch, NeuraLoc-Core resolves the platform application-data directory and creates `neuraloc-core.db` plus workload-specific folders under `models` and `outputs`, along with `prompts`, `downloads`, `cache`, and `logs`. SQLite uses WAL mode and foreign keys. Browser preview does not use this data directory or native model imports.

Normal desktop communication uses Tauri IPC. Network features default off, and no local API server is currently implemented. Models and large outputs remain ordinary files; SQLite stores metadata.
